description: "Explanation of the Quick Window"
---

This window is accessed when you `Double-Click` on thumbnails
- Allows you to instantly view images within a series
- Has similar tools as the [Image Window](/en/image-window); `Right-Click` on the image for image manipulation tools

> 📝 **Note:** The main difference between the Quick and Image Window is that Quick does not allow you to visualize different studies side by side

## Notable Functionality

### 1. Toggle between different series in the same study

- Use the "Monitor" buttons to toggle between series/screens

> 💡 **Tip:** The Left and Right arrow keys on the keyboard does this as well!

### 2. Change to different series of a different study

- Instead of navigating back to the [Information Window](/en/info-window), we can bring up the Patient History by:

    <br />

    1. `Right-Click` the image, then select `[Display Another Series...]`

    <br />

    - A new `Select Series` Window pops up, which contains that Patient History panel and the Thumbnail panel

    2. `Double-Click` the study on the right to open it in the the Thumbnail panel, then `Double-Click` or `Drag` the thumbnail onto the Quick Window to view the series stack

### 3. Change Tile Display

- To display more than one image at a time in the series, `Right-Click` the image, hover over `[Stack Tile]`, then select the desired grid display:
