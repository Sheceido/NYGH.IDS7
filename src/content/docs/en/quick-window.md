This window is accessed when you `Double-Click` on thumbnails
- Allows you to instantly view images within a series
- Has similar tools as the [Image Window](/en/image-window); `Right-Click` on the image for image manipulation tools

> 📝 **Note:** The main difference between the Quick and Image Window is that Quick does not allow you to visualize different studies side by side
