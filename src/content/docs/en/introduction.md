#### **Welcome to the unofficial Sectra IDS7 documentation at NYGH!**

>  ðŸš§ **Under Construction:** This site is currently in `BETA`, certain links will return `404 Error` as they are still a work in progress.

Here you will find the accumulated knowledge for quick-referencing the IDS7 software functionality and relevant workflows to follow.

The primary initiative for this project was to generate a persistent, easy, and quick reference accessible on the web for current and future users of the software at North York General Hospital. The site is intended for NYGH staff use only. All images only reference mock-patient data.

Quickly find the topic you're looking for along the left hand side panel on desktop, or open the hamburger dropdown menu on mobile.

You do not need to view the topics in chronological order - here's a quick summary for each section:

| IDS7 GUI:   |
| ----------- |

Explains the four primary windows you will be navigating back-and-forth, a breakdown of the important sections/panels, and notable functionality that you'll commonly need to execute.


| WORKFLOWS:   |
| ------------ |

Modality-specific example workflow.


| TOOLS QUICK REFERENCE:   |
| ------------------------ |

Most common functionalities you'll employ on a day to day basis.

| ADVANCED:   |
| ----------- |

Features that can be implemented for the savviest of technologists, which are optional and provide diminishing returns of increased efficiency.
