#### **Welcome to the unofficial Sectra IDS7 documentation at NYGH!**

>  ðŸš§ **Under Construction:** This site is currently in `BETA`, certain links will return `404 Error` as they are still a work in progress.

This text offers a concise overview of the IDS7 software and its associated workflows. It serves as a readily accessible reference for current and future users at North York General Hospital (NYGH). The website is exclusively for NYGH staff and contains images that depict fictional patient data.

To navigate the content, use the left-hand side panel on desktop or the hamburger dropdown menu on mobile. You can choose any topic of interest without following a specific order. Below is a brief summary of each section:
