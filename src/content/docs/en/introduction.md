##### **Welcome to the custom *and* unofficial Sectra IDS7 documentation at NYGH!**

Here you will find the accumulated knowledge for quick-referencing the IDS7 software functionality and relevant workflows to follow.

The primary initiative for this project was to generate a persistent, easy, and quick reference accessible on the web for current and future users of the software at North York General Hospital. The site is intended for NYGH staff use only. All images only reference mock-patient data.

If you have any suggestions, concerns, and/or corrections, please feel free to email the <a href = "mailto: leonpoon@hotmail.ca">site developer</a>.

Quickly find the topic you're looking for along the left hand side panel on desktop, or open the hamburger dropdown menu on mobile.
