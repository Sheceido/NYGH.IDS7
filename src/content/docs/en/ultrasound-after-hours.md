## A) Assign to US After Hours

For studies that are not to be reported by Radiologists of the day:

1. Make sure the Green Arrow is pointing to the study you want to assign a `[NonCheck]` status to, if not `Right-Click` the study in the [Patient History panel](/en/info-window#patient-history) and select the first option:

    ![Set Current Exam](/basics/set-current-exam.png)

2. On the toolbar at the top, click the `[NonCheck]` button:

    ![Non-Check Button](/workflow/us/noncheck-button.png)

The study should now be flagged as `[NonCheck]` and the `"US After Hours"` Worklist should now contain this study.

> üìù **Note:** Make sure your study does not have a reading physician set if it is marked for `[NonCheck]`.

## B) Morning Batch-Assign to Radiologist

If the morning technologist needs to assign studies within `"US After Hours"` Worklist to an appropriate Radiologist:

1. `Left-Click` the `"US After Hours"` Worklist on the left panel in the [Information Window](/en/info-window).

2. **Batch assign** by holding `[Left-Shift]` on your keyboard, then `Left-Click` a range of studies.

3. With a few studies highlighted, `Right-Click` any of one of them, hover over `[Reading Physician]`, then select `[Set Reading Physician]`, navigate to the Radiologist group, and finally select the appropriate Radiologist that is to dictate these After Hours cases.
- Refer back to [Set Reading Physician](/en/ultrasound-workflow#set-reading-physician) for more brevity.

> üìù **Note:** Once a Radiologist have begun reporting a case within `"US After Hours"`, the case should drop-off from this worklist. You may change the assigned Radiologist anytime before dictation.
